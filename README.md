# Binance-Trading-Bot
A C++ bot that uses Bianance's RESTful API alongside Microsoft's C++ RESTsdk

So far this bot has only been confirmed to connect to Binance's RESTful API. 
The implementation of the HMAC SHA256 algorithim to generate a signiture works, but the rest of the program is not yet fitted to run with it as I wrote it in C and the rest is in C++.
